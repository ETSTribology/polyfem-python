The python bindings are in alpha. Expect a lot of API changes and possible bugs. Use at your own peril!

<br/>
I am making efforts to provide a simple python interface to Polyfem.

For doing so I am maintaining  a *conda* package which can be easily installed [https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/polyfempy](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/polyfempy).

Note that the conda deployment is slow and this tutorial will follow the deployment version.

If you hare in a hurry for the juicy latest feature you can clone the repository [Polyfem-python](https://github.com/polyfem/polyfem-python) and use `pip` to install:
```
python setup.py install
```
and
```
python setup.py test
```
for testing.
